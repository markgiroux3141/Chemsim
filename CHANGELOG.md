# Changelog

Newest first. One entry per session, twelve lines at most, enforced by
`tools/check_docs.py`. When this file passes 400 lines the older half rolls into
`docs/history/changelog-YYYY-MM.md`.

## 2026-09-02 — the handoff is frozen, capped and made repeatable

Moved the seven root monoliths (1.5 MB, 84% narrative) into `docs/history/`,
rewrote the 53 references, and split the milestones file on its own headings into
79 sections (largest 23 KB) behind an index, verified line by line. Added
`CLAUDE.md`, `NEXT.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, this file, `check.ps1`, and
`tools/check_docs.py`, which caps the working set and ratchets existing debt in
both directions. `README.md` 662 -> 561: the Status paragraph ("Layers 0-6
complete; 275 tests" against 1,264) is a table of regenerable numbers, the false
`[done]` on Layer 4.5 and the untrue RDKit-boundary claim are corrected, 32
glyphs gone, qualitative kinetics stated in Known limitations. Decided in
`BACKLOG.md`: delete `discovery/refine.py`; adopt reachable-reactions and reject
a self-scored family checklist; defer the README trim into C1. Added the
`handoff` skill. Next: T1.0, the extractability measurement.
